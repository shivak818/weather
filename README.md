## Description

In this Next.js project, a weather app is developed with Tailwind CSS and Open-Meteo APIs for weather and search related data. It includes current, daily, and hourly weather data (temperature, high/low, feels-like, wind, precip) sourced from the open-meteo API. The app detects the user's city automatically through browser geolocation and allows manual city search.
