# weather
This project is a weather application developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the Open-Meteo APIs for retrieving weather and search data. 
The app provides current, daily, and hourly weather information, including temperature, highs and lows, feels-like temperature, wind, and precipitation, all sourced from the Open-Meteo API.
It automatically detects the user's location via browser geolocation and also allows for manual city searches
To start the development server, use the command #npm run dev
After running the server, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.
This Next.js weather application was created with inspiration from various online resources and tutorials. The project was driven by a desire to learn, understand new concepts, and engage in research and development.
